I took a highschool diploma in Biotechnology and chemistry: im capable of doing PCR testing.

I learned to tackle multiple things at once, while working at Q8, since I was alone in the shop.

I was responsible for handling company customers at Bauhaus.

My slogan is "if its worth doing, then its worth doing properly".

Everything i do, i try to be a perfectionist about it.

I'm fluent in english, danish and somewhat capable of understanding french and spanish due to my understanding of latin.

My highschool exam project was using c sharp (unity) to make a game.
