}{% the abstract
  This project is going to focus on the theme "Digital CV" 
  which this project will find a problem for those people who struggle with making a CV,
  and the reasons behind the rejection. Especially for the unemployed, there potential wasted by a process the seemingly unfair.
  The project aims to find a software solution that can produce Digital CV 
  and will aid for a higher chance of getting past the ATS scanner and hiring personnel.
  During the project two tests were conducted, to evaluate if the Digital CV fulfilled the project's objective.
  One for the ATS scanner and one for one of the hiring personnel. 
  The feedback concluded that structure and contents were essential to get a good result and only one of them did the program succeed in.
  The test results were mixed, with the Digital CV having moderate success at passing the hiring personnel, though poor success at passing the ATS scanner.
  These results indicate that the projects objective was not fully meet.
