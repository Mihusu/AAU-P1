\subsection{Different expectations in a company}
Often in the different companies they have a different structure and information of what a CV could have in their application.
Most of the time the companies expectations can be related to work experience and education,
and a CV could either be long or short depends on which company the person is writing to. Some people can write a long CV,
but it isn't necessarily a good CV, and people can write a short one but it isn't good enough. 
Both of these statements could have some information that are not relevant to the companies requirement.
