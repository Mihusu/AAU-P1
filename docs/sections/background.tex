\subsubsection{The numbers behind the process of getting a job}
How did people get their current job?
Lou Adler tried answering just this: He conducted an online survey
on linkedin based on 3000 answers, where in most of these answers
came from those actually hiring.

The results are outlined in the illustration underneath:
\includegraphics{figures/hiringpeople.png}
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/

Here we can see, that active candidates only represent 5-20 percent of the
entire jobmarket. Around 15-20 percent are only tiptoeing around the idea
of getting a new job, while the rest are passive candidates (meaning people who are
satisfied in their current position.).

Based on these graphs, we can see that at the very minimum, 42 percent of people are
hired based on networking, and that is only if you already have a job.
Whilst this percentage only goes up, the oppertunity for a job seeking person
to get hired based on an application goes down. This reflects the
most effective way to get hired is through internal applications or networking.
On the flip side, it also nicely illustrates just how stiff competition there actually is,
if your only way of getting hired is through sending applications.

When you send out an application, there is an 8.3 percent probability, that
they will actually invite you to a job interview. Furthermore it takes around
10-15 interviews, before one gets a job offer. Obviously it varies depending
on educational background, job type and many other factors, but this is the average.
Some quick math ( (((100/8,3)*10)+((100/8,3)*15))/2 = 150..) tells us, that it will
take an average of 150 ish applications before one gets a job offer.

All these applications add up, before one can reap the reward. According to a
study conducted surveying 2000 Americans, by recruitment agency Randstad US
discovering the “art of the job hunt”, it takes an average of five
months from when the job search begins, until one actually lands
the job.
https://www.swnsdigital.com/2018/10/it-takes-5-months-of-searching-to-land-a-job-study-finds/

To add insult to injurry, after all the hard work of creating an application, it can
take quite some time before the hiring managers actually respond, that is if they ever
bother answering your application to begin with.
It takes around 3 days between they receive the application, before they answer.
This is the case for the most in demand roles in society, for the less in demand roles
such as writers, nurses and unskilled labour, it can be anywhere from 10 to over 30 days.
https://talent.works/2017/09/22/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-60-days-if-youre-in-hr-or-sales/
On average one can expect to hear back from employers within a week 41 percent
of the time. Within a couple of weeks 85 percent of the time.

Below some of the more popular jobs are illustrated as a function of interview
rate on the left and response delay on the left:

https://talent.works/2017/09/22/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-60-days-if-youre-in-hr-or-sales/
The interview rate is further supported from a danish online survey, that concluded
that 65 percent of people get an interview within the first 15 applications and
 82.5 percent of people get an interview within the first 30 applications.

\subsubsection{Optimize ones interview rate}
There are many factors to consider, if one wishes to optimize ones
chances of getting an interview, one of the more empirical proven ones
is what time and day one sends their application.
To get the highest chances, you have to apply between early Tuesday morning
and Thursday before noon using the employers local time. Monday is even better,
increasing your chances by 46 percent in regard to the average.
If one should apply on another day, the most important factor is that
it's done before 10AM, since the interview chances drops below 5 percent for
the majority of late evening pplications.
https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/30/best-times-days-submit-resume/

One thing that is crucial, is how long ones resume is:
Having between 475-600 words is the optimal length, where the maxima is at
ca. 535 words. The optimal word count is illustrated below:
\includegraphics{figures/longresumegraph.png}

Perhaps one of the most influential condition of weither you get an interview,
is how fast you are at applying:
Based on 30000 datapoints from the company Speedrecruiters, you need
to apply within the first 14 days to have a practical chance of getting an
interview. it is such that 50 percent of the people who got an interview
for the job applied within the first week, and 75 percent of those who
got an interview applied within the first 14 days, whilst the chancess of
getting an interview thereafter dwindles exponentially.
https://www.jobfinder.dk/artikel/her-bedste-tidspunkt-at-sende-din-ansoegning/220987

Other factors that influence the interview rate are as following:
1. Being a woman increases the chances by 48 percent.
2. Being older, but no older than 35, increases the interview rate by 25 percent.
3. Having more than one degree, increases ones chances by 22 percent.
4. Adding industry buzzwords increases your chances by 29 percent.
   e.g. If you are a software developer, then add buzzwords such as machine learning,
   artificial intelligence etc.
5. Demonstrating earlier job results using numbers increases chances by 40 percent.
   e.g. "Increased profits by 20 percent from Q3 to Q4"
6. Listing achievements, where you weren't in charge, but only a helping hand
 decreases your chances by 50 percent
   e.g. "Helped management organize financial reports" instead of "Organized financial reports"
7. Using leadership affiliated buzzwords increases your chances by 51 percent
8. Not using personal pronouns in the employment section increases your
chances by 55 percent.
9. Including a key skills section and buzzwords of the key skills increases your
 chances by 59 percent
10. Start ones sentences with distinct action verbs, increases ones chances by 140 percent.
   e.g. Do "Developed a mainframe architecture that drammatically increased efficiency"
   instead of "After surveying people, the mainframe architecture that increases efficiency was
   developed by me"

\subsection{Different expectations in a company}
Often companies have different expectations for structures and information's about the CV, so it will be relevant for the application.
Most of the time the companies expectations can be related to work experience and education,
and a CV could either be long or short depends on which company the person is writing to. Some people can write a long CV,
but it isn't necessarily a good CV, and people can write a short one but it isn't good enough.
Both of these statements could have some information that are not relevant to the company's requirement. Still there are some other
factors that can be included, and some companies would love to know what the person did in that particular year.
In that particular situation would be different from company to company, since those people who are working with humanities
can have human related criteria for getting a job in this area. The same goes for IT where they have more work with a computer

than any other people, because these jobs immerse themselves everyday with it. According to Computerworld it-jobbank,

have more of a technical, structured and professional knowledgeable side than before.

That is tough very common, since will take good technical skills to do a very good job with the programming,
and structured can be a very important factor to have a good overview of a program,
and even if a new person with almost zero experience had to look at that,
it would still be possible to read trough the comments and understand it's functions. Below is the full result
of the 6700 job-advertisements that has been thoroughly examinant.

In the situation of the contents and the document setup, there can be often of those different kind of setups, 
there is one in particular and they are a comparative effectiveness research, and it's called 
Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). 
This organization have a purpose to fund research, so they can afterwords help patients and in the end try to make them better
informed to look at their health that they face every day.

Header: Include the Principal Investigator’s (PI’s) full name in the top left corner of the page header on every page. \\
Margins: Use at least half-inch margins. The header may fall within the top margin, but the body text should not begin closer than one half-inch from the edge of the page.
Font: Use size 11 Calibri for the main body of the text. Figures, tables and captions may be size 8 font.

Even tough that applicants have wrote a good CV and they have used some good words to describe themselves, 
there is a chance where keywords come in as a very important factor. In the digital world where often people have to send applications online, and over 90 %%
of all resumes and relevant information are being screened through an "Applicant Tracking System" (ATS). ATS is a scanning software system 
that is designed to scan a resume for "work experience, skills, education, and other relevant information." https://www.zipjob.com/blog/ats-resume-test/
If it determines the resume is a good match for the position, it gets sent forward to the hiring manager. 
Every time the ATS will do test, and it will determine if the test is a passing grade or it will be delete, so it will not even reach out to the hiring manager. 
According to Caitlin Proctor it is stated that "Nearly 75 %%
of resumes are rejected because they’re not correctly formatted or keyword optimized." and there can be a lot of criteria 
to get to the job you want. https://www.zipjob.com/blog/ats-resume-test/
So ind the end, the ATS is checking especially on five different elements when writing a resume, and that can be:
% Skal jeg beskrive om de 3 andre emner?
Standard formatting
Keyword optimization
Send as a Word document
Spell out abbreviations
Include relevant information

\subsection{Required and adviced content of a CV}
A CV  is “a short account of one’s career of qualifications prepared typically by an applicant for a position”1. When applying for a position within a form some aspects of a CV are required. These requirements can come from the position or firm the CV is intended or from the definition of the CV itself.
Putting aside the firm or positions requirements, all CV’s must include the five following requirements to be defined as a CV:

1. Contact information
2. CV objective
3. Relevant skills
4. Work experience
5. Education

The substance of each requirement varies from applicant to applicant. However, every CV must include these five requirements to be effective. A further explanation of each requirement is due:
Contact information is required as the firm at the bare minimum must have some way to contact you should you be accepted for the position. CV objective is required as it specifies what and who the CV is intended and without it the CV can fill no purpose. Relevant skills are required as without it you have no relation to the CV objective. Work experience and Education is required as without it one has no qualifications, as a CV is an account of one’s qualifications it is also possible to leave this empty if one has none, however it is then hardly a CV.  3
Along with the requirements of CV there are also aspects which are advised. These vary and must likely the firm or position in which one is applying to will lay out these aspects. However, if not specified it is also advised to include anything Certification and awards
