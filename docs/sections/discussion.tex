\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
Even though the program works much to the intent, it still leaves a multitude of things to be desired:
If two sections has the same content, but formulated in different ways, both sections will be included.
This makes the finished product seem unprofessional at best. As an example, with the keyword "English", and the sentences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 1. "Fluent in English"
  \item 2. "Mastery level of English grammar"
\end{itemize}
Both mean approximately the same, but only one sentence should be included. For this, one could envision a system, where only the section that matches "English" with the highest density, should be included.\\

Another problem stems from the fact, that the output can seem disjoint, cold and robotic. This could be fixed, if the filter was capable of understand basic semantics, and filling in conjunctions that make the output more cohesive.\\

The structure, depending on which industry, may not always be the best suited structure for the job position. If one was to develop further, this will surely have to be more dynamic.\\
