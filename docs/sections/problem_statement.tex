\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem}
How can we make a software solution, that enables the British and American unemployed people, 
to create a large number of CV applications.
Such that they can get a higher chance of getting past the ATS scanner and hiring personal, than
if they were to individually create each application while expending little effort?
