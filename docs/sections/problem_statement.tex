\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem}
How can we make a software solution, 
that enables the British and American unemployed people,
 to create a large quantity of CV applications that get 
 through the ATS scanner and hiring personal such that they have an 
 interview rate on par or better than if they were to individually create 
 each application, while expending little effort.
