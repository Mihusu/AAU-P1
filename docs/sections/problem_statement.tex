\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem}
How can we make a software solution, 
that enables the British and American unemployed people, to create a large number of CV applications that can get 
a higher chance of getting passed the ATS scanner and hiring personal, 
if they were to individually create each application while expending little effort?
